Problem Statement The ultimate Soccer database for data analysis and machine learning The dataset comes in the form of an SQL database and contains statistics of about 25,000 football matches, from the top football league of 11 European Countries. It covers seasons from 2008 to 2016 and contains match statistics (i.e: scores, corners, fouls etc...) as well as the team formations, with player names and a pair of coordinates to indicate their position on the pitch. 

+25,000 matches 
+10,000 players 11 European Countries with their lead championship
Seasons 2008 to 2016 
Players and Teams' attributes* sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates 
Team line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates) 
Betting odds from up to 10 providers 
Detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etc...) for +10,000 matches The dataset also has a set of about 35 statistics for each player, derived from EA Sports' FIFA video games. It is not just the stats that come with a new version of the game but also the weekly updates. So for instance if a player has performed poorly over a period of time and his stats get impacted in FIFA, you would normally see the same in the dataset. 

Object predict the overall rating of soccer player based on their attributes such as 'crossing', 'finishing etc.
